## Projects

### [Is there evidence of climate change in the US tornado statistics?](../../../us_tornado_stats)
I visualized and analyzed tornado data from the National Centers of Environmental Information to validate statements in National Geographic online educational articles about long-term tornado trends.

### [Building product recommendation engine from Retailrocket shopping cart data](../../../product_recom_eng)
I built a prototype recommendation engine based on a machine learning model trained on shopping cart data and evaluated its success rate on the held-out test data.

### [Clustering algorithm based on projections and visual analytics approach](../../../projection_based_clustering)
I developed a new clustering algorithm that combines the visual pattern recognition ability of humans with the power of automated processing.
