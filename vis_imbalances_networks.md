Topological and spectral imbalances in 3 sample real-world networks. **A.** Network of feeding relations between species or groups of species in the cypress wetlands of South Florida during the dry season. **B.** Network of friendship relations between boys in an Illinois high school in 1957â€“1958. **C.** Network of connections between Gnutella host computers in 2002.
