Topological and spectral imbalances in 3 real-world networks. (A) Network of feeding relations between species or groups of species in the cypress wetlands of South Florida during the dry season. (B) Network of friendship relations between boys in an Illinois high school in 1957â€“1958. (C) Network of connections between Gnutella host computers in 2002.
